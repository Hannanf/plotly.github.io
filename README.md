______________________________________________________________________
The purpose of this module included using JavaScript to filter belly button biodiversity data. We created a website using Github Pages to showcase our data. The website includes a dropdown filter to search through various samples. Once the user has chosen the sample set, the website showcases demographic information about the sample, top 10 bacteria found in the sample, frequency of the numbers of scrubs per week, and a graph showing the bacteria cultures per sample. I have included a sample picture below of the website as seen below (Image 1)
